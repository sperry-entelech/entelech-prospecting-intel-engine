| R002 | Service disruption due to cloud outage | Low (2) | High (4) | 8 | Multi-region deployment | DevOps Team | Planned |
| R003 | Insider threat - data exfiltration | Low (2) | Critical (5) | 10 | DLP + access monitoring | HR + Security | Active |
| R004 | Third-party service failure | Medium (3) | Medium (3) | 9 | Vendor SLA monitoring | Vendor Mgmt | Active |

### Risk Treatment Options

1. **Avoid:** Eliminate the risk by not performing the activity
2. **Mitigate:** Implement controls to reduce probability or impact
3. **Transfer:** Use insurance or contractual arrangements to transfer risk
4. **Accept:** Accept the risk when cost of mitigation exceeds benefit
