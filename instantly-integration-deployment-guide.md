## Database Migration Steps

### Step 1: Schema Updates

Execute the updated database schema to replace ConvertKit tables with Instantly integration:

```sql
-- 1. Drop existing ConvertKit tables (backup first!)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS convertkit_integrations CASCADE;

-- 2. Execute the updated schema
\i prospect_intelligence_schema.sql
```

### Key Schema Changes
- `convertkit_integrations` â†’ `instantly_integrations`

### Step 2: Data Migration

If migrating from existing ConvertKit data:

```sql
-- Migrate existing prospect data to Instantly format
INSERT INTO instantly_integrations (
    tenant_id, company_id, lead_status, sync_status, 
    custom_fields, tags, created_at
)
SELECT 
    ck.tenant_id,
    ck.company_id,
    CASE ck.subscription_status
        WHEN 'active' THEN 'active'
        WHEN 'unsubscribed' THEN 'unsubscribed'
        ELSE 'cold'
    END,
    'pending_migration',
    ck.custom_fields,
    COALESCE(ck.convertkit_tag_ids, '[]'::jsonb),
    ck.created_at
FROM convertkit_integrations ck;
```

## n8n Workflow Deployment

### Step 1: Import New Workflows

Import the following workflow files into your n8n instance:

1. **Primary Integration**: `n8n-prospect-intelligence-crm-integration.json`
2. **Email Activity Monitor**: `n8n-instantly-email-activity-monitor.json`
3. **Campaign Optimization**: `n8n-instantly-campaign-optimization.json`

### Step 2: Configure Webhook Endpoints

Set up webhooks in your Instantly account:

```
Activity Webhook: https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/instantly-webhook
CRM Integration: https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/crm-integration
```

### Step 3: Workflow Configuration

Update each workflow with your specific credentials and endpoints:

```javascript
// Example credential configuration in n8n
{
  "instantly": {
    "apiKey": "{{ $env.INSTANTLY_API_KEY }}",
    "baseUrl": "https://api.instantly.ai/api/v1"
  },
  "postgres": {
    "host": "your-postgres-server.postgres.database.azure.com",

Subject: Quick question about {{company_name}}'s {{top_opportunity}}

Hi {{first_name}},

I noticed {{company_name}} is in the {{industry}} space and likely handling {{top_opportunity}} manually.

Our analysis suggests this could be costing you approximately {{top_opportunity_savings}} annually in time and inefficiencies.

Would you be open to a 15-minute conversation about how we've helped similar {{industry}} companies automate this process and achieve {{total_roi}} in measurable ROI?

Best regards,
[Your Name]

P.S. Happy to share a brief case study of a {{company_size}} {{industry}} company that achieved {{package_price}} worth of automation value.
```

#### 4. Campaign Assignment Issues
```sql
-- Test campaign assignment function
SELECT get_optimal_campaign_assignment(75, 35000, 'Technology Services', 'medium', 3);

-- Check lead scoring calculation
SELECT calculate_lead_score('company-uuid-here');
```

#### 5. AI Analysis Failures
- Verify Claude API key and quota
